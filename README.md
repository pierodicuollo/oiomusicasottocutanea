# oiomusicasottocutanea



For the final project of the Internet of things course, we were commissioned to create an interactive object for OIO, an italian musical collective.

We created an handmade wooden box that can be connected in input to a PC (expected future integration with Raspberry Pi or UDOO) and in output to a projector. The box receives, in input, a software developed in Processing, with different visual elements. Through Arduino's mediation, it is possible to switch from one visual to another interacting with the interface of the box. On the interface were designed buttons with conductive ink to allow connection with Arduino. A microcontroller has also been introduced to model some parameters, set for sketches in Processing.

I took part in all the realization phases, within a team of seven people. However, in particular, my focus was on the visual and conceptual coordination of work as well as on the development of sketches in Processing.
